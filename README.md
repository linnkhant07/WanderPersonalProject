# Noteify Me

## Introduction

Welcome to Noteify Me! Our platform revolutionizes studying by turning your school notes into interactive quizzes with the help of OpenAI. Create an account on our website, store your notes from different subjects, and receive daily quiz questions on Discord, get instant feedback, and enhance your learning through active recall.
